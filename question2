A String S is given as input.Your task is to find and print the count of charactersoccuring more than twice continuously in a given string S.
Note:1.String s contains both uppercase and lowercase.
     2.Assume that the Uppercase alphabets and lowercase alphabetsare not same


import java.util.Scanner;

public class ConsecutiveCharacterCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Getting the string input from the user
        System.out.print("Enter the string S: ");
        String S = scanner.nextLine();

        // Calling the method to find and print the count of characters occurring more than twice consecutively
        int count = countConsecutiveCharacters(S);

        // Displaying the result
        System.out.println("Count of characters occurring more than twice continuously: " + count);

        scanner.close();
    }

    public static int countConsecutiveCharacters(String S) {
        int count = 0;
        int length = S.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < length; ) {
            char currentChar = S.charAt(i);
            int consecutiveCount = 1;

            // Count how many times the current character repeats consecutively
            while (i + consecutiveCount < length && S.charAt(i + consecutiveCount) == currentChar) {
                consecutiveCount++;
            }

            // Check if the character repeats more than twice consecutively
            if (consecutiveCount > 2) {
                count++;
            }

            // Move the index to the next different character
            i += consecutiveCount;
        }

        return count;
    }
}
